## Howto

SSH to your RHEL9 box.

Register your box:

```bash
[root@vm2 ~]# subscription-manager register
Registering to: subscription.rhsm.redhat.com:443/subscription
Username: your-username
Password: 
The system has been registered with ID: xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx
The registered system name is: vm2.example.org
````

Install [Yara](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/): `dnf install yara -y`

Install the Insights Client: `dnf install insights-client -y`

Register your box with Insights (it connects to the account used by subscription-manager):

```bash
[root@vm2 ~]# insights-client --register
Successfully registered host vm2.example.org
Automatic scheduling for Insights has been enabled.
Starting to collect Insights data for vm2.example.org
Uploading Insights data.
Successfully uploaded report from vm2.example.org to account 123456.
View the Red Hat Insights console at https://console.redhat.com/insights/
```

Perform a test scan:

```bash
[root@vm2 ~]# insights-client --collector malware-detection
Starting to collect Insights data for vm2.example.org
Writing the malware-detection app default configuration to /etc/insights-client/malware-detection-config.yml

```

Log into [the Cloud Console](https://cloud.redhat.com).

**IMPORTANT:** given the sensitive nature of malware detection, you need to be an admin or your Red Hat account to access the malware section.

Navigate to Red Hat Enterprise Linux > Red Hat Insights > Malware

Find your new system that says "Not matched".

Disable the test scan:

```bash
[root@vm2 ~]# sed -i 's/test_scan: true/test_scan: false/' /etc/insights-client/malware-detection-config.yml
```

Run the malware detection again: 

```bash
[root@vm2 ~]# sed -i 's/test_scan: true/test_scan: false/' /etc/insights-client/malware-detection-config.yml
[root@vm2 ~]# insights-client --collector malware-detection

If you check the console again, no match is found.

Download EICAR. EICAR is a "simulation malware" file recognized by most anti-virus and malware detection engines and it is perfectly safe to use!

```bash
[root@vm2 ~]# curl https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt > /root/mw.txt
```

Run the malware detection again: 

```bash
[root@vm2 ~]# insights-client --collector malware-detection

Check the cloud console again. You will find a match in red.

## Next Steps

Automate the insights install and configuration using the insights collection for Ansible.

Community Supported: https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhatinsights/insights  
Red Hat Supported: https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/redhat/insights/  

Automate your malware scans using an Ansible Automation Platform schedule. We don't have a module in the collection for now, but that's coming up soon enough!
